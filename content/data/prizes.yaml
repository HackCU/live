- title: "Kids + Bikes = happier, more attentive students in the classroom"
  type: sponsor
  description: !markdown |
    It’s a pretty simple formula: kids + bikes = happier, more attentive students in the classroom, and for the past few years, The Specialized Foundation has been helping this happen. We’re dedicated to giving both schools and children the tools to achieve academic, health, and social success. However, we believe this benefit increases when taken beyond the school and into the home.
    
    **The winner of this challenge will design a family based app or program that encourages kids to put down their phones & game consoles and throw a leg over their bike to experience the same wonders of the outdoors as we did. Your hack will be judged on its ability to extend the Riding For Focus program into the home, and extend it by adding elements not capable in a school setting. Make sure your solution gives parents the peace of mind that their kids (and their data) is safe.**
